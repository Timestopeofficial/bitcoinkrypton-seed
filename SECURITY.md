# Security Policy

Krypton is the world’s first browser-based blockchain and ecosystem. We look forward to working with the community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our protocol and official implementations as safe as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Krypton is committed to working with researchers who submit security vulnerability notifications to us to resolve those issues on an appropriate timeline and perform a coordinated release, giving credit to the reporter if they would like.
